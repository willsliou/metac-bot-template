The Fossil Sphere: Led by the U.S., which uses its massive oil/gas production and the recent capture of Venezuela's reserves to keep energy prices low and maintain geopolitical leverage.

The Mineral Sphere: Led by China, which has spent 20 years building the factories that turn raw "dirt" into the copper and lithium required for the future.
